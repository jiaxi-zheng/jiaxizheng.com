abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) equipped with collision resistance can operate more confidently in areas with difficult-to-detect and avoid objects. This paper proposes an icosahedron tensegrity structure equipped with triboelectric soft stretchy sensors for a collision-resistant AUV. Specially, we construct a six-bar tensegrity using 24 separate soft sensors whose voltage output varies in response to the length variation of the sensors. The locations of the icosahedron's 12 nodes are determined using a motion-capture system when the icosahedron deforms in response to impact forces. The observed voltage and position data are utilized to train the transformer network, which results in the construction of a prediction model capable of accurately describing the shape change during the tensegrity deformation process. Experiments demonstrate that due to our design's potential to supply accurate posture predictions, AUV can successfully reorient itself after collision obstacle.
