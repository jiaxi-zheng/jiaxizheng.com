Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are routinely used to perform complex underwater tasks, such as environmental monitoring, oceanographic mapping, and organism capture. These tasks require an AUV’s ability to perform autonomous navigation, especially under the condition of limited communications in underwater environments. In this paper, a new breed of lightweight intervention AUV is developed for autonomous navigation using data from multiple inertial sensors, where multi-sensor error state Kalman filter schemes are preferable than standard Kalman Filters in terms of the AUV’s motion estimates. With respect to target recognition, a color restoration method is provided for degraded underwater images, as well as a You Only Look Once strategy combined with topological analysis for object detection. In addition, the proposed design is robust in both its mechanical structure and software components, and provides a feasible platform for secondary development. Experiments of surveying and object manipulation carried out in actual conditions demonstrate the applicability of the system and its potential applications in science and industrial fields.
