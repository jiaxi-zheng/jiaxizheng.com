I am an undergraduate at Dalian Maritime University. The main research directions are robot Design, Control, Fabrication and Simulation. In November 2019, I met Professor Minyi Xu. He introduced me to the fantastic world of Underwater Robots.In Lab of Marine Self-Powered System Lab, I started my investigation from Underwater Robots Fabrication. So far, my work superauv has gone through 3 Iterations.
