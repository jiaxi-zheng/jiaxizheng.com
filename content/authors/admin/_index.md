Robotics enthusiasts who believe that the only goal of technology should be to achieve. Enable people, enable creativity, enable great products or new ideas. My research background is mainly in the balance of control and robotics, mechanical and software design. Over the past few years in this industry, I’ve  done many interesting experiments with robotics combined with nanosensors, and I’ve learned to appreciate human factor considerations more when designing good technology, and I’m aiming in these directions to Learn further and contribute to a real technology.

Outside of research, my interests include Photography, DIY Drone, Cycling, Football, and Travel.
