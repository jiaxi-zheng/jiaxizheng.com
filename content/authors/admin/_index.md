I'm a Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, advised by Prof. Howie Choset. Prior to this, I served as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Westlake University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Dixia Fan and Prof. Kwok Wai Samuel Au. I received my B.E. degrees at Dalian Maritime University, advised by Prof. Minyi Xu and Prof. Guangming Xie.
My research interests revolve around Bio-inspired Robotics and Bio-inspired Sensor, with a recent focus on Underwater Swarm Robotics. 

Currently, I'm actively seeking a Ph.D. position to further pursue my passion for robotics and contribute to cutting-edge research.

Outside of research, my interests include Photography, Travel, Cycling and Football.
